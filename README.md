# RollingSpiderController
Controller mobile application for Parrot RollingSpider drone 

The purpose of this project is to have new ways to control the RollingSpider drone.
I am sure we can do better than the actual official app.

Thanks to parrot for the open source sdk they deliver at https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3

And thank to my former colleagues for giving me the RollingSpider as a parting gift ;)
