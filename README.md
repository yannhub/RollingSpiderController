# RollingSpiderController
Mobile application for controlling the Parrot RollingSpider drone 

The purpose of this project is to have new ways to control the RollingSpider drone.

Thanks to parrot for the open source sdk they deliver at https://github.com/Parrot-Developers/ARSDKBuildUtils

And thank to my former colleagues for giving me the RollingSpider as a parting gift ;)
